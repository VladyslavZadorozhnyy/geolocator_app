# GeoLocatorApp

Project is made for Android only.

## Following 3rd party libraries were used
- flutter_bloc: for implementing Cubit approach
- sqflite: for storing requested previously data
- charts_flutter_new: for providing stats on how much time in general was needed for previous data retrieving

## Needed to mention:
  - DI (dependency injection) was not applied yet, as it was not part of the problem
